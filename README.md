Retrofit

JSONPlaceholder (Fake API)

# API Usage Instructions
The app uses Retrofit library to make HTTP requests to the JSONPlaceholder fake API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

Product data is fetched from the /products endpoint, while user data is retrieved from the /users endpoint.

Retrofit handles the API requests and responses, parsing JSON data into Kotlin objects for easy consumption within the app.
